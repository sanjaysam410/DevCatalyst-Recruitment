I am especially interested in exploring areas like development, UI/UX, and content creation, and I believe this club will help me gain hands-on experience. Being part of DevCatalyst will also improve my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills by working on events and initiatives.

I break the brief into key points and identify the main message that needs to be communicated. If anything is unclear, I prefer clarifying it before starting.
Next, I do some quick research for inspiration, trends, and references that align with the theme. I then brainstorm ideas and create a rough concept or outline. For visual content, I think about layout, colors, typography, and overall aesthetics. For written content, I focus on tone, clarity, and engagement.
After creating the first draft, I review it to ensure it matches the brief and effectively communicates the message. I refine the design or content by improving structure, correcting errors, and enhancing visual appeal. Before delivering, I double-check details and make final adjustments. I’m open to feedback and revisions because I believe good content becomes great through refinement and collaboration.","Colours,font style,images","If I receive feedback that my design “doesn’t feel right” without specific details, I would respond calmly and professionally.

I believe clarity is important for improvement.
I would request examples or references to better understand their expectations. After gathering clearer input, I would revise the design accordingly and present an improved version. I also like to explain my design choices briefly, so there is mutual understanding.

I first read the instructions carefully to know what the final outcome should be, who the audience is, and what message needs to be communicated. This helps me get a clear direction before starting the work.
Next, I spend some time thinking and gathering ideas. I may look for inspiration, examples, or references related to the topic so that I can understand what works well. After collecting ideas, I start planning the structure of the content. I create a rough outline or draft to organize my thoughts and make sure the message is clear.
Once the basic idea is ready, I begin creating the actual content. During this stage, I focus on making it simple, engaging, and easy to understand. After completing the first version, I review the work carefully to check for mistakes and improve the quality. I also make small changes to make the content clearer and more effective.
Finally, I make the final adjustments and deliver the content, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the brief and communicates the message properly.","A good poster should clearly communicate its message and attract attention. Three essential elements of a good poster are:
1. Clear and Simple Message
A good poster should have a clear main idea that people can understand quickly. The message should be short, direct, and easy to read so that viewers can grasp the purpose of the poster within a few seconds.
2. Attractive Visual Design
Visual elements like images, colors, icons, and graphics help make the poster eye-catching. A good design grabs attention and helps explain the message visually. The visuals should be relevant to the topic and not overcrowded.
3. Proper Layout and Readability
The information should be well organized with proper spacing, headings, and readable fonts. Important information such as the title or key points should stand out. A clean layout makes the poster easy to read and understand.
Together, these elements help a poster effectively attract viewers and communicate its message quickly and clearly.","If I receive feedback that my design “doesn’t feel right” without specific details, my first step would be to politely ask for more clarification. I would try to understand what exactly the person feels is missing or unclear. For example, I might ask whether the issue is related to the colors, layout, message, or overall style. This helps me understand the expectations better.
Next, I would review my design carefully and try to see it from the viewer’s perspective. I would check whether the design clearly communicates the message, whether the layout is balanced, and whether the visuals match the purpose of the content.
After that, I would make a few alternative changes or improvements based on the feedback and share them with the team for further suggestions. This allows us to compare options and choose the best version.
I believe feedback is an important part of the creative process. Even if it is not very specific at first, it gives an opportunity to improve the work and create a design that better matches the audience’s expectations and the project’s goals.",Canva,,,,,,,,,,"I would like to know more about the opportunities available for members to learn and grow within the club.

I would also like to understand how members can contribute ideas and take initiative in organizing events or projects. Being part of a team where everyone’s ideas are valued would be a great experience.
Apart from this, I would like to share that I am a motivated learner who enjoys exploring new skills and working with others.

I believe it is a platform where I can learn by working on real projects instead of only studying theory. I enjoy hands-on learning, and I feel that DevCatalyst will give me the right environment to explore, experiment, and build meaningful solutions.

I am also excited about the opportunity to work with like-minded people who are serious about learning and improving themselves. Being part of such a community will motivate me to stay focused and push my limits. I want to challenge myself, learn from my mistakes, and become more confident in my abilities.

Another reason I want to join DevCatalyst is to gain guidance from experienced mentors. Learning from people who have real industry experience will help me understand how things work in the real world. Overall, I see DevCatalyst as a place where I can develop my technical skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities while preparing myself for future opportunities.","By the end of this academic year, I hope to gain strong practical skills and real project experience through this club. I want to improve my technical knowledge and understand how to apply what I learn to solve real problems. Instead of just knowing concepts, I want to be confident in building something useful from start to finish.

I also hope to improve my communication and teamwork skills. Working with different people will help me learn how to share ideas clearly, listen to others, and handle responsibilities properly. I want to become more disciplined and consistent in my work.

Another goal is to build at least one or two meaningful projects that I can proudly showcase in my portfolio.

I had to print the poster, cut it properly, and paste it neatly on a large cardboard for decoration at the entrance.

While working on it, I made a mistake. I didn’t measure the cardboard correctly before cutting the poster. After pasting, I realized the alignment was slightly tilted and one side had less margin. It didn’t look clean, and since it was the main display, it was noticeable.

At first, I felt stressed because we were already short on time. But instead of leaving it as it was, I told the team about the mistake. I carefully removed the poster, reprinted it, and this time measured everything properly before cutting and pasting. I also asked one teammate to check the alignment before fixing it permanently.

In the end, the final board looked neat and attractive. That situation taught me to double-check measurements and not rush important work.",,Yes,,"Priority Ranking:

I would treat the projector failure as the top priority because the event is starting in 30 minutes, and technical issues can stop the entire program. If the projector is not working, presentations, visuals, and even the flow of the event can be affected.

My first action would be to immediately call the technical team and check whether it’s a cable issue, power problem, or device fault. At the same time, I would arrange a backup option like another projector or even a large display screen if available. If no replacement is available, I would quickly inform the speakers to be ready to continue without slides and adjust the program accordingly.

The speaker cancellation would be handled next by rearranging the schedule or assigning another person to fill that slot.

I would focus on companies that may benefit from student exposure, hiring interns, or increasing brand visibility.

Next, I would shortlist five companies based on relevance, size, and their interest in youth engagement. I would learn about their work, recent achievements, and values so that our approach feels personal and not generic.

For approaching them, I would first try connecting through LinkedIn or email with a short and clear message explaining who we are, what DevCatalyst does, and how the partnership can benefit both sides. I would highlight benefits like brand promotion, talent access, and event visibility. If possible, I would also request a short meeting to discuss collaboration in detail.","You should definitely watch Fear on Prime Video if you enjoy suspense and psychological thrillers.

Instead of generic messages, I’d craft tailored emails or LinkedIn messages highlighting why that specific company is a good fit and what they gain.

Another reason could be overthinking — wondering whether my email is professional enough or whether I’m reaching out to the right person.

Dear Founder’s Name,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Bharath Pathi, and I am part of the organizing team at DevCatalyst, a student-driven technical community focused on fostering innovation and practical learning.

I'm excited about being part of a community that focuses on practical skills and teamwork. I don't just want to learn theory - I want to apply what I learn to solve real problems and improve step by step.

I'm especially interested in gaining hands-on experience, collaborating with like-minded people, and receiving constructive feedback that helps me improve faster.

At the same time,I also believe I can contribute with my dedication, willingness to learn, and positive attitude. At the same time, I know DevCatalyst will challenge me and help me become a better developer.

Overall, I see DevCatalyst as an opportunity to challenge myself, expand my technical and teamwork skills, and grow in a focused, supportive environment.
","By the end of this academic year through this club, I hope to achieve both technical growth and personal development.

Technically, I want to strengthen my core skills by working on real-world projects, improving my problem-solving ability, and gaining hands-on experience that goes beyond classroom learning. I hope to become more confident in building complete projects — from planning and development to testing and presentation.

I also want to improve my teamwork and communication skills by collaborating with other members, sharing ideas, and learning how to work effectively in a group. Being part of a team will help me understand different perspectives and develop leadership qualities.

Most importantly, I want to build a strong foundation that prepares me for internships and future opportunities.

We had already divided the work among the team members, and everyone was responsible for completing their assigned part. However, just a day before submission, one of our teammates informed us that he wouldn’t be able to finish his section on time due to some personal reasons.

At first, the team felt stressed because the deadline was very close, and his part was an important section of the presentation. Instead of blaming him or panicking, I decided to focus on finding a solution. I suggested that we quickly review the incomplete section, divide it among the remaining team members, and work together to finish it that same day. I also helped reorganize the slides so that the flow of the presentation would remain clear and consistent.

We coordinated properly, supported each other, and stayed calm while completing the extra work. I took responsibility for compiling all the slides, checking for errors, and ensuring the final presentation looked polished and well-structured. In the end, we successfully completed the presentation and submitted it on time.

This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, staying calm under pressure, and taking initiative when something goes wrong. I learned that problems can be solved more effectively when we focus on solutions instead of blaming others, and that leadership sometimes means stepping up quietly to support the team when it matters most.",,No,,"1) Projector fails
2) 50 more people show up
3) Keynote speaker cancels

Why this order?

1) Projector fails (Highest Priority)
This is an immediate technical issue that can completely stop the event from running as planned. If the projector is needed for presentations, visuals, or the keynote, the event cannot proceed smoothly without it. It affects the entire audience at once.

First Action:
Immediately contact the technical team or venue support to troubleshoot the issue. At the same time, arrange a backup solution — such as another projector, a different room setup, or switching to a no-slides format if necessary. While this is being handled, I would inform the team to keep attendees engaged (music, networking, announcements) to avoid confusion or frustration.

2) 50 more people show up
This is a logistics challenge — seating, materials, and space management must be adjusted quickly. However, it is manageable if the team coordinates properly (adding chairs, adjusting registration, sharing materials digitally).

3) Keynote speaker cancels
While important, this can be handled by adjusting the schedule — replacing the speaker with a panel discussion, a backup speaker, or moving another segment forward. It affects the program but doesn’t physically stop the event from starting.

Think of this like you are in a toy store, and you want a certain toy car from the back room. You don't go get it yourself; you tell the storekeeper exactly what you want, such as ""the red race car with shiny wheels."" The storekeeper goes to get it, checks if it's okay, and brings it right to you.

APIs Are Like That Storekeeper
APIs are very helpful messengers for computers. When one app (like your game) wants information from another app (like the weather app), it asks the API nicely: ""Hey, what's the weather today?"" 

How It Works Super Simply
The API goes to the weather app, gets the sunny or rainy stuff, and brings it right back fast—without the two apps ever meeting in person. It's like magic notes that help phone games, maps, and videos all work together nicely!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
